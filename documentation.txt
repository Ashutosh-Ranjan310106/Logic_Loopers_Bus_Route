Bus Route Database Documentation


Overview

The Bus Route Database is designed to manage the operations of a bus transportation system (mainly city local bus like DTC BUS).
This database structure captures various aspects of the bus system, including bus types, users, stops, routes, tickets,
schedules, and staff, employee. The primary goal of this database is to facilitate effective management and tracking of bus operations.


Features of Our project 
1) Data Integrity: The database enforces data integrity through the use of primary keys, foreign keys, and unique constraints, ensuring that relationships between tables are maintained.

2) Comprehensive Ticket Management: The system effectively manages both online and offline tickets, allowing for clear tracking of ticket sales and validity

3) Staff Management: Detailed information about staff roles (drivers and conductors) allows for efficient resource management within the transportation system.

4) Dynamic Route Management: The database facilitates dynamic handling of routes and stops, enabling real-time updates to schedules and routes.

5) Reporting and Analysis: The structure allows for the generation of various reports, such as ticket sales, staff assignments, and bus schedules, aiding decision-making processes.

6) User Management: Detailed user records help in tracking customer demographics and preferences, which can inform marketing and operational strategies.

7) Employee Management: employee records with there level of access to database and who can do what in database

for testing we have taken following route map:-
Route 1:
[Stop a] -> [Stop b] -> [Stop c] -> [Stop d] -> [Stop e] -> [Stop f]

Route 2:
[Stop d] -> [Stop i] -> [Stop j] -> [Stop h] -> [Stop g]

Route 3:
[Stop c] -> [Stop i] -> [Stop k] -> [Stop h] -> [Stop f]
